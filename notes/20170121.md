* [`dictionary.get()`](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/dictionary_get.htm) method for avoiding raising an error when a key is not found in a dictionary.
  * Syntax: `dict.get(key, default = None)`
  * If the key is not available, then the default value returned is `None`.

  * `print('-' * 3) # Prints ---`

* [Sum all elements in a list](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11344827/summing-elements-in-a-list)
  * Use the `sum()` built-in, syntax: `sum(your_list)`
  * e.g. if `my_list = range(10,17)` then `sum(my_list)` returns 91
  * e.g. if `my_list = ['5', '4']` then `sum(int(i) for i in my_list)` returns 9

* [Iterating over key/value pairs, or just keys, or just extract keys from dict](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3545331/how-can-i-get-dictionary-key-as-variable-directly-in-python-not-by-searching-fr)
  * Iterate over keys with
  ```python
    for key in dict:
      ...
  ```
  * Iterate over keys and values with
  ```python
    for key, value in dict.iterItems():
      ...
  ```
  * Can also get keys as iterable with `.keys()`
  ```python
  dict = {1: 2, 3:4}
  dict.keys()
  # => dict_keys([1, 3]) which is an Iterable
  list(dict.keys())
  # => [1,3]
  iterator = iter(dict.keys())
  next(iterator)
  # => 1
  next(iterator)
  # => 3
  next(iterator)
  # Raises StopIteration Error
  ```

* [`continue` vs `pass`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9483979/is-there-a-difference-between-continue-and-pass-in-a-for-loop-in-python)
  * `pass` simply does nothing, while `continue` goes on with the next loop iteration

* [Randomly selecting an item from list](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/306400/how-do-i-randomly-select-an-item-from-a-list-using-python)
  * Use `random.choice`
  ```python
  import random
  foo = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
  print(random.choice(foo))
  ```
